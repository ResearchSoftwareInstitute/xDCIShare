  - question: What is an advance directive?
    name: what_is_an_advance_directive

It allows you to select a trusted person to speak on your behalf about your care if you cannot speak for yourself. Each state has its own version. View our recommended version for North Carolina <a href="/states/nc/template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
