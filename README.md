MyHPOM
============

MyHPOM is a collaborative website being developed for better management of personal health and healthcare information. MyHPOM is derived directly from the NSF-funded 3-clause BSD [HydroShare open source codebase](https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare), NSF awards [1148453](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148453) and [1148090](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148090). MyHPOM provides the sustainable technology infrastructure needed to address planning and communicating important information about your future healthcare wishes to those closest to you and those who provide medical care to you.
